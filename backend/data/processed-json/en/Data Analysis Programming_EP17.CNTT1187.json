Students can analyze the nature of data, classify data, and come up with appropriate data analysis methods. Students can understand and use R data analysis software (or equivalent software) to program to perform data analysis programming with common data analysis problems, common data analysis problems. Advanced data analysis with integrated software packages and data connectivity from database management systems. The module provides learners with knowledge about data collection and processing processes, data preprocessing, data representation, and some basic and advanced data analysis methods. The module guides learners on the skills to use R data analysis software to perform basic analysis and other advanced analyzes such as clustering, decision trees, and financial data analysis. Through the learning process, students will practice independent working skills, teamwork skills and problem presentation skills as well as have a sense of professional ethics.",

COURSE DESCRIPTIONS\nThe Data Analysis Programming module is a specialized module, aiming to provide content so students can clearly understand data and its basic characteristics. Students can analyze the nature of data, classify data, and come up with appropriate data analysis methods. Students can understand and use R data analysis software (or equivalent software) to program to perform data analysis programming with common data analysis problems, common data analysis problems. Advanced data analysis with integrated software packages and data connectivity from database management systems. The module provides learners with knowledge about data collection and processing processes, data preprocessing, data representation, and some basic and advanced data analysis methods. The module guides learners on the skills to use R data analysis software to perform basic analysis and other advanced analyzes such as clustering, decision trees, and financial data analysis. Through the learning process, students will practice independent working skills, teamwork skills and problem presentation skills as well as have a sense of professional ethics.\n3.

COURSE REQUIREMENT & EXPECTATION\n9.1. Requirements for taking final /terminal exams\n- Students are allowed to take the final exam if their attendance score reaches 5 points or more (on the scale of 10).\n9.2. Requirements for attending classes\n- Students are responsible for attending all classes. In case of absence from school due to force majeure reasons, sufficient and reasonable proofs must be provided. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted 1 point. Students who miss any classes more than 3 times, with or without reason, will be considered as failing to complete the course and have to re-register.\n- Students will be awarded points for constructive comments these points are added to attendance points and group assignments.\n- Groups who do not submit the group work will receive a score of 0 (zero). Late submissions will be deducted for each day of late submission.\n9.3. Requirements for in-class behaviour\n- The course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behaviour that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.\n- Students must come to class on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.\n- Laptops and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking notes for and calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely forbidden to use for other purposes.\nFaculty Dean | NEU’s President\nPhD Pham Xuan Lam | Prof. PhD Pham Hong Chuong"
