        "This course is to prepare students of the Software Engineering\t major with fundamental knowledge of  electricity and magnetism, including: The basic concepts of electric charge and the force between them,  the concepts of the electric field and electric potential, capacitance and energy storage in an electric field;  A current in turn intrinsically produces a magnetic field, examining the force a magnetic field exerts on moving charges and learn how to relate a magnetic field to the current that produces it; Properties of conductors and dielectrics in electric fields and applications; Magnetic nature of magnetic materials and applications; escribing the effects of  time varying magnetic and electric fields, this leads us into Maxwell's Equations and electromagnetic waves. The applications of this topic are fundamental to our society as it encompasses such matters as communication by electromagnetic radiation, functioning of our nervous system and operation of all electronic circuits. This course also helps students obtain other skills: problem solving and teamwork."
