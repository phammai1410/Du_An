COURSE DESCRIPTIONS\nThis course provides basic knowledge about methods and skills to create data, search and exploit data, and perform administrative operations on the system. The database management use Microsoft SQL Server will be used as a tool to illustrate and simulate the problems that will be presented because it is a relatively complete database management system. The function of a database management to act as a data server. Write SQL commands to create databases, create tables, insert/update/delete/retrieve rows in a common database management system.\nThis course, student learn about constraints, learn about how to create a constraint, types of constraints, and difference between unique, not null and primary key constraints. Student learn about types of SQL Statements, Databases in SQL Server. How to create a database, datatypes in SQL Server, and about DDL Statements, DML Statements. Learn how to create a stored procedure and difference between stored procedure and table, advantages of procedures and about types of parameters\n3.
