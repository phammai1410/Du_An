Additionally, the module delves into fundamental security management techniques pertinent to databases, encompassing access control, user administration, and rights management. Furthermore, it explores methods to bolster software application security and addresses challenges associated with accessing and manipulating databases from applications. Moreover, the module introduces procedures for formulating security policies, implementing continuous monitoring practices, and maintaining proactive security stances."
