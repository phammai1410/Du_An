CLASS REGULATION\n9.1. Requirements for taking final/terminal exams\n- Students are allowed to take the final exam/terminal exam (50%) if their attendance score (10%) reaches 5 points or more (scale of 10).\n9.2. Requirements for attending classes\n- Students/students are responsible for attending all classes. In case of absence from school due to force majeure, there must be sufficient and reasonable proofs. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted from the process assessment. Students who miss more than 3 classes, with or without reason, will be considered as not completing the course and must re-register.\n- Students will be added points for each construction speech, which can be compensated for attendance points and test scores.\n9.3. Requirements for in-class behavior\n- The course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and teachers. Any behavior that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.\n- Students must come to school on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class.\n- Absolutely do not make noise, affecting others during the learning process.\n- Absolutely do not eat, chew gum, use devices such as phones, music players during class time.\n- Notebooks and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking lecture notes, calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely not for other purposes.\nFaculty Dean | NEU’s President\nPhD Pham Xuan Lam | Prof. PhD Pham Hong Chuong"
