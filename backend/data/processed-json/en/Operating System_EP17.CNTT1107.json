Students who miss any classes more than 3 times, with or without reason, will be considered as failing to complete the course and have to re-register.\n- Students will be awarded points for constructive comments these points are added to attendance points and group assignments.\n- Groups who do not submit the group work will receive a score of 0 (zero). Late submissions will be deducted for each day of late submission.\n9.3. Requirements for in-class behaviour\n- The course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behaviour that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.\n- Students must come to class on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.",

COURSE DESCRIPTIONS\nThe operating systems course is intended as a general introduction to the techniques used to deploy operating systems, the types of system software involved, and the historical development of operating systems. This course consists of: (1) Operating system function, structure, service (2) Process and Thread management (states, creation, synchronization, and communication); Process scheduling (short-term, long-term, medium-term); prevent, avoid and overcome deadlocks; (3) Main memory management; virtual memory management (swapping, paging, segmentation, and page replacement algorithms); (4) Mass storage and disk management; (5) File system structure and implementation; (6) I/O devices and peripheral;  (7) Protection and Security.\n3.
