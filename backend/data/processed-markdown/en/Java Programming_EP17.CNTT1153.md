# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

This course provides foundational knowledge in Java programming, such as OOP, input/output processing, multithreading, and using libraries to build user interfaces (UI). The content of the course includes Basics of Java programming; Object-oriented programming; Exception handling; Input/output processing; Collection frameworks; Generic programming; Java 8+ features. The course also aims to develop critical thinking skills, the ability to self-learn knowledge, and technologies related to Java by working independently as well as in groups. Students will be divided into groups to delve deeper into various technologies, allowing them to present and discuss individual or group solutions to address issues.
