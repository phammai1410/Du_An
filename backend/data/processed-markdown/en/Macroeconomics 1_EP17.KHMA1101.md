# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

This course introduces the fundamentals of macroeconomic theory and explains their relevance to everyday economic problems. It examines the behavior of macroeconomic variables, such as national income, unemployment, inflation, and exchange rates. The short-run economic fluctuations and the role of monetary and fiscal policies are also discussed.

At the end of the course, you will be able to understand fundamental macroeconomic issues in your world. In particular, you may be able to answer questions such as why some countries have high inflation rates while others have stable prices. How can we explain fluctuations in national economic activity? What can macroeconomic policies do against unemployment and inflation?
