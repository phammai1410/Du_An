# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

The course aims to provide students with knowledge of software testing, software, testing procedures and basic techniques in test design and installation testing, and help students develop the ability to design tests and evaluate the effectiveness of testing a specific software in practice. In addition, the course also provides understanding and how to use some of the error management tools, and automation testing tools.

Course content includes:

* Overview of software testing
* Testing in the software development process
* Test plan
* Design test case
* Methods and techniques testing
* Executing test by using tools
* Log bugs

The course also aims to train thinking skills, the ability to self-study knowledge, and technology to develop mobile applications by working independently as well as in groups. Students will be **divided into groups** to learn deeply about technologies, from which they can present in their solutions using new technologies to develop mobile applications.
