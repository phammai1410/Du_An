# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

The course provides foundational knowledge on system analysis and design and object-oriented analysis design. The content of the course includes: the concepts of system, information system, system development life cycle, system development team, development methods system development, software development process, unified modeling language UML; Survey the system and initialize a system development project; Business modeling, structure and behavior modeling of system; architecture design, user interface design, class and data design.

The course also aims to develop critical thinking skills, the ability to self-learn knowledge, and technologies related to system analysis and design by working independently as well as in groups. Students will be divided into groups to delve deeper into various technologies, allowing them to present and discuss individual or group solutions to address issues.
