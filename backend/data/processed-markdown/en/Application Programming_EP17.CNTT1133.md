# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

This course provides foundational knowledge about programming on Windows, helping students grasp programming methods and use the tools of object-oriented programming languages, especially approaching and understanding problems. applicable. Students learn specifically about the C# Language, introducion controls, and also connect with a database management system to build practical application problems

This course also aims to train thinking skills and the ability to self-learn knowledge about programming methods on Windows by working independently as well as in groups. Learners have the skills to build a practical, applicable application with an appropriate database.

This course discusses the powerful query capabilities in the language syntax of C# and the model for querying relational databases.
