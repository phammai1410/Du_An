# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

This course aims to provide foundational knowledge in software architecture and software design methodology. It introduces concepts, principles, and methodologies for creating high-quality designs for software development. Learners will gain insight into software design principles and learn how to design software using templates for applications, websites, or web services.

The course covers software design processes, models, and principles, including object-oriented design principles such as the UML language. Additionally, it offers knowledge about software engineering, software architecture models, and methodologies for designing software architecture and components in object-oriented software design.

Students will utilize the knowledge and methods gained in this course to solve real-world problems by designing architecture and detailing software development.
