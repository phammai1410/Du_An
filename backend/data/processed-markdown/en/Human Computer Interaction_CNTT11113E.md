# 3. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

Interaction between humans and computers is a complicated process with many rewards. Designing computer systems that are effective, efficient, easy to use, and enjoyable is important to realize the benefits of computation-based devices. The difficulties inherent in balancing the constraints of various aspects of human life create a complex web. The reward is the creation of digital libraries where scholars thousands of miles away can find and flip through virtual medieval manuscripts; medical instruments that enable a surgical team to design, locate and monitor a complex neurosurgical procedure; virtual worlds for entertainment and social interaction, responsive and efficient government services, from online license renewal to analysis of parliamentary testimonies; or smartphones that know where they are and understand limited language Interaction designers create meaningful interactions in virtual worlds and embed them seamlessly in physical worlds.

The goal of this subject is to introduce visual, gesture and speech interface technologies to students in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). We are focused on applications and services in intelligent environments and the personalized and context-sensitive interfaces that come with them. This course will teach you all you need to know about the user interface and software ergonomics.
