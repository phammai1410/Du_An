# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to information technology, covering key concepts such as history of Information technology, information, information processing, information systems, electronic computers, hardware, and software and careers in Information Technology. Students will explore the fundamentals of computer problem-solving, including numbering systems and data representation methods for integers, real numbers, characters, sounds, and images. The course also delves into the structure of essential computer components, including the CPU, input and output systems, interconnections, and memory.

In addition to theoretical knowledge, students will gain hands-on experience with widely used software, including operating systems and office applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The course also introduces basic programming techniques in C or Python, providing a solid foundation for further study in these languages.

Beyond imparting technical skills, this course is designed to develop students' critical thinking and self-study abilities, promoting both independent and collaborative work. By the end of the course, students will be able to tackle fundamental IT problems, effectively utilize Windows operating system features and office applications, and solve basic programming challenges using C or Python.
