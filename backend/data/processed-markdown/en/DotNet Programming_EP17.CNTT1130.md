# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

The module helps students understand and fluently use the .Net Programming language. Know programming techniques with ADO.Net. Students practice submission exercises on the Window Form platform and work with databases, applying problems in Economic and Technical management. Students know how to use the basic structures of programming languages, work with databases and reports. Ability to program management problems in economics and learn technology as well as any programming language that interacts with databases.

The module also aims to train thinking skills and the ability to self-learn knowledge about .Net Programming methods by working independently as well as in groups. Learners have the skills to build a practical, applicable application with an appropriate database.
