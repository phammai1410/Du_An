# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTION

A Basic module of the bachelor's degree program modules is related to information technology, computer science, data science and fintech.... Discrete mathematics is a branch of Mathematics that studies discrete rather than continuous structures. The course also aims to train thinking capacity and calculation skills and improve the ability to apply mathematical knowledge to analyze and research problems in information technology. The course equips learners with the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies to study and research related subjects in the training program and continue to higher education. At the end of the course, learners can do a graph network data analysis project.

**Course outline:**

* Logic and Set
* Proofs
* Functions, Strings and Relation
* Algorithms
* Introduction to Number Theory
* Counting problems and Dirichlet’s Principle
* Graph Theory
* Tree

**Seminar talks**: The goal is to introduce state-of-the-art applications of discrete mathematics in the modern technology. Besides, invited student-speakers can be included to share about their scientific projects related to the course’s materials.

**Outcomes assessment:**

* (10%) Participant
* (40%) Quiz + Midterm: quiz 1 (10%), quiz 2 (10%), project presentation (5%) and midterm (15%).
