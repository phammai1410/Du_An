# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

The course aims to provide students with basic knowledge of **application programming on mobile devices with Android** or **iOS**. Students will be instructed to use **Java** and **Objective** **C,** **Swift** ... or cross-platform tools such as **Xamarin**, **Reactive Native, Flutter** ... Students will be equipped with knowledge depending on each different platform to program, develop, and distribute mobile applications.

Course content includes:

* Overview of mobile programming
* Development tools
* Components of a mobile application
* Mobile User Interface (UI)
* Store data online/offline.
* Multitasking and asynchronous processing
* Build applications based on device features.
* Learn and use APIs.
* Application testing and distribution

The course also aims to train thinking skills, the ability to self-study knowledge, and technology to develop mobile applications by working independently as well as in groups. Students will be **divided into groups** to learn deeply about technologies, from which they can present in their solutions using modern technologies to develop mobile applications.

Applications will be developed during the learning process through lessons and group exercises:

1. **Calculator:** Application that can perform basic math operations.
2. **Notes:** Application for taking notes and managing tasks.
3. **Clock:** Create a simple clock application.
4. **Unit Converter:** Application that supports measurement and unit conversion.
