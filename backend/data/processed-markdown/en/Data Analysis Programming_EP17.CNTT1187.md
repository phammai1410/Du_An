# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

The Data Analysis Programming module is a specialized module, aiming to provide content so students can clearly understand data and its basic characteristics. Students can analyze the nature of data, classify data, and come up with appropriate data analysis methods. Students can understand and use R data analysis software (or equivalent software) to program to perform data analysis programming with common data analysis problems, common data analysis problems. Advanced data analysis with integrated software packages and data connectivity from database management systems. The module provides learners with knowledge about data collection and processing processes, data preprocessing, data representation, and some basic and advanced data analysis methods. The module guides learners on the skills to use R data analysis software to perform basic analysis and other advanced analyzes such as clustering, decision trees, and financial data analysis. Through the learning process, students will practice independent working skills, teamwork skills and problem presentation skills as well as have a sense of professional ethics.
