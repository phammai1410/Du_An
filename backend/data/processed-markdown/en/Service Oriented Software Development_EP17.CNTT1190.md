# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

The module provides knowledge about service-oriented software development concepts, architecture, methods and tools so that students can apply them to practical problems during their studies as well as after graduation. In the first part, the module introduces an overview of service-oriented software development and techniques in service-oriented software development. The next part introduces the service-oriented architecture model and foundation, principles and properties of service-oriented software systems. The module also provides details about the platform, technology, process and how to develop Web services: SOAP and RESTful. Finally, the module also provides knowledge about the system life cycle, system building strategies, service-oriented modeling approach and basic steps to build a service-oriented system.
