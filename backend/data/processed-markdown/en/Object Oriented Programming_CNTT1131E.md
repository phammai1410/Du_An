# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

This course provides knowledge about: Basic concepts of object-oriented programming such as classes, objects, constructors, destructors, friend functions.... The characteristics of object-oriented programming methods such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. Methods of analysis and design of problems in an object-oriented approach; I/O stream operations and file operations. How to catch and handle exceptions. The content of the object-oriented programming method is described through the C++ programming language (Can also use the C# or Java programming language to illustrate)

The course also aims to practice thinking skills, the ability to self-learn the knowledge of object-oriented programming methods by working independently as well as in groups. Learners have the skills to build a real application using object-oriented programming methods.
