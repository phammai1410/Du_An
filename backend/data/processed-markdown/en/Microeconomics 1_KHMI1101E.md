# 2. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

Microeconomics 1 is an introductory undergraduate course that provides a solid foundation for economic thinking and analysis. This module begins with an introduction to supply and demand and the fundamental forces that determine equilibrium in a market economy. It introduces a framework for learning about consumer behavior and analyzing consumer decisions. The module then addresses firms and their decisions about optimal production, and the impact of different market structures on firms' behavior. The final part of the module introduces some of the more advanced topics that can be analyzed using microeconomic theory, including international trade and the role of government.
