# 3. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

This module introduces the operations of computer systems at the level of instruction set architecture (ISA). It provides a basic understanding of the design principles of modern computers and their components. The course focuses specifically on pipeline techniques, memory tiered design. Implementation issues are also emphasized. Performance measurement and analysis methods are also discussed to evaluate different architectures.

The course also aims to train thinking ability, calculation skills and improve the ability to apply knowledge to analyze and research problems in the field of computer architecture. The course equips learners with the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies to search, retrieve and exploit subject-related resources and continue to higher education.
