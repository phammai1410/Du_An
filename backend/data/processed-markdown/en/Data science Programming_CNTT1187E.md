# 3. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

This course provides basic knowledge Data Analytical. Data Analytical Programming is a specialized course that provides content so that students can understand data and its basic characteristics. Students of analysis is the nature of data, classifying data, giving appropriate data analysis methods. Students can understand and use R data analysis software (or equivalent software) to set up a program to perform data analysis setup with applied information data analysis problems. , math problems. Advanced data analysis with software packages that unify and connect data from database management systems.

The course provides learners with knowledge about the process of data collection and processing, data preprocessing, data representation, some basic and advanced data analysis methods. The course teaches learners the skills to use R data analysis software to perform basic analyzes and other advanced analyzes such as clustering, decision trees, and financial data analysis. Through the learning process, students will practice more independent working skills, teamwork skills, problem presentation skills as well as a sense of professional ethics.
