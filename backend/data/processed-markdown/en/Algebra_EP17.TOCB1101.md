# 3. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

The Algebra module belongs to the General Education Knowledge block of the bachelor's degree program in Economic Mathematics, Information Technology and Computer Science. This module equips learners with basic knowledge about sets, maps, polynomials, vector spaces, quadratic forms and effective calculation tools for systems of linear equations, matrices, and determinants. The course contribute to training scientific thinking and building a mathematical foundation for application in analyzing and researching problems in the fields of economics and business. With the knowledge, skills and competencies equipped, after completing this course, learners can easily access a number of programming languages ​​such as R, Python, ... as well as the ability to study other related subjects in the training program such as Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Optimization Theory, Discrete Math.

The course consists of 6 chapters: Chapter 1 introduces the concepts and operations of sets, maps and polynomials; Chapter 2 presents vector spaces and linear relationships between vectors; Chapter 3 deals with the concepts, properties, and operations of matrices and determinants; Chapter 4 includes the contents of the system of linear equations and its applications in economics; Chapter 5 introduces linear mappings; Chapter 6 presents the basic concepts of quadratic forms and methods of identifying definite quadratic forms.

# 9. COURSE REQUIREMENT & EXPECTATION

## 9.1. Requirements for taking final /terminal exams

* Students are allowed to take the final exam/terminal exams (50%) if their attendance score (10%) reaches 5 points or more (on the scale of 10).

## 9.2. Requirements for attending classes

* Students are responsible for attending all classes. In case of absence from school due to force majeure reasons, sufficient and reasonable proofs must be provided. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted 1 point. Students who miss any classes more than 3 times, with or without reason, will be considered as failing to complete the course and have to re-register.
* Students will be awarded points for constructive comments these points are added to attendance points and group assignments.
* Groups who do not submit the group work will receive a score of 0 (zero). Late submissions will be deducted for each day of late submission.

## 9.3. Requirements for in-class behaviour

* The course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behaviour that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.
* Students must come to class on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.
* Laptops and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking notes for and calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely forbidden to use for other purposes.
