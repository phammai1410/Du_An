# 3. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining course will provide students with basic knowledge, methods and skills of data analysis using advanced methods of data mining to discover knowledge from large data sets that traditional methods do not perform effectively. In this course, we will use BI tools in the database management system Microsoft SQL Server version 2008 and above and some open source tools to illustrate and simulate the problems that will be presented. The course contents include Basics of knowledge discovery and data mining, Data preprocessing, Association rule mining, Data classification, Cluster analysis, Trends and problems of data mining.
