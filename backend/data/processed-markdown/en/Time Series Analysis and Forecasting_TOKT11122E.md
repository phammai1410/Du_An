# 3. COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course provides an introduction to time series analysis, highlighting its applications in the stock market and includes setting up Anaconda Python and Jupyter. Starting with NumPy, students will learn about arrays, indexing, and operations, applying these to create stock market indicators such as SMA, EMA, MACD, and RSI through hands-on exercises. The focus then shifts to Pandas for data handling and analysis, teaching students about Series, DataFrames, and data visualization, with practical exercises on stock market data. Students will explore visualizing financial time series and delve into advanced analysis with Statsmodels, covering error, trend, and seasonality decomposition. The curriculum includes forecasting models, from basics to complex concepts like ARIMA, SARIMA, and GARCH models, complemented by code-along sessions. By the course's end, students understand how to apply time series in analyzing and forecasting stock market trends with Python's powerful libraries, ready to apply these skills in financial contexts.
