In the first part, the module introduces an overview of service-oriented software development and techniques in service-oriented software development. The next part introduces the service-oriented architecture model and foundation, principles and properties of service-oriented software systems. The module also provides details about the platform, technology, process and how to develop Web services: SOAP and RESTful. Finally, the module also provides knowledge about the system life cycle, system building strategies, service-oriented modeling approach and basic steps to build a service-oriented system."
