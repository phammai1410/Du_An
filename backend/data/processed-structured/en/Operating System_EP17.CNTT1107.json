This course consists of: (1) Operating system function, structure, service (2) Process and Thread management (states, creation, synchronization, and communication); Process scheduling (short-term, long-term, medium-term); prevent, avoid and overcome deadlocks; (3) Main memory management; virtual memory management (swapping, paging, segmentation, and page replacement algorithms); (4) Mass storage and disk management; (5) File system structure and implementation; (6) I/O devices and peripheral; (7) Protection and Security.\n* Text Books: Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, Greg Gagne; Operating System Concepts; 10th Edition, Wiley.\n* Additional references:\nTable 4. Course goals\nTable 5. Course learning outcomes (CLOs)\n* Assessment methods:\n- Grading: 10\n- Average score of course is the total points of rubrics multiplied by the respective weight of each rubric.\n* Assessment summary:\nTable 6.

Requirements for taking final /terminal exams\nStudents are allowed to take the final exam if their attendance score reaches 5 points or more (on the scale of 10).\n9.2. Requirements for attending classes\nStudents are responsible for attending all classes. In case of absence from school due to force majeure reasons, sufficient and reasonable proofs must be provided. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted 1 point. Students who miss any classes more than 3 times, with or without reason, will be considered as failing to complete the course and have to re-register.\nStudents will be awarded points for constructive comments these points are added to attendance points and group assignments.\nGroups who do not submit the group work will receive a score of 0 (zero). Late submissions will be deducted for each day of late submission.\n9.3. Requirements for in-class behaviour\nThe course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behaviour that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.\nStudents must come to class on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.\nLaptops and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking notes for and calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely forbidden to use for other purposes."
