It provides a basic understanding of the design principles of modern computers and their components. The course focuses specifically on pipeline techniques, memory tiered design. Implementation issues are also emphasized. Performance measurement and analysis methods are also discussed to evaluate different architectures.\nThe course also aims to train thinking ability, calculation skills and improve the ability to apply knowledge to analyze and research problems in the field of computer architecture. The course equips learners with the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies to search, retrieve and exploit subject-related resources and continue to higher education.\nCourse books:\n[1] John L. Hennessy (2012) Computer Architecture - A quantitative Approach, Mk Publisher.\nReference books:\n[2] Patterson, D. A., and J. L. Hennessy. Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, 3rd ed. San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufman, 2004. ISBN: 1558606041.\nTable 5.1. Course Objectives\nTable 6.1. Course Learning Outcomes\nTable 7.1. Course assessment\nTable 8.1.

In case of absence from school due to force majeure, there must be sufficient and reasonable proofs. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted from the process assessment. Students who miss more than 3 classes, with or without reason, will be considered as not completing the course and must re-register.\nStudents will be added points for each construction speech, which can be compensated for attendance points and test scores.\nThe course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and teachers. Any behavior that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.\nStudents must come to school on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class.\nAbsolutely do not make noise, affecting others during the learning process.\nAbsolutely do not eat, chew gum, use devices such as phones, music players during class time.\nNotebooks and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking lecture notes, calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely not for other purposes."
