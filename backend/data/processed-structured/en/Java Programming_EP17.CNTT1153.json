The content of the course includes Basics of Java programming; Object-oriented programming; Exception handling; Input/output processing; Collection frameworks; Generic programming; Java 8+ features. The course also aims to develop critical thinking skills, the ability to self-learn knowledge, and technologies related to Java by working independently as well as in groups. Students will be divided into groups to delve deeper into various technologies, allowing them to present and discuss individual or group solutions to address issues.\n* Textbooks/Lecture Notes:\n[1] Pham Xuan Lam (2024), Java Programming, National Economics University\n* Additional references:\n[2] Introduction to Programming Using Java – 8th David J.

Lesson plan for the course\nStudents are allowed to take the final exam if their attendance score reaches 5 points or more (on the scale of 10).\nStudents are responsible for attending all classes. In the case of absence from school due to force majeure reasons, sufficient and reasonable proofs must be provided. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted 1 point. Students who miss any classes more than 3 times, with or without reason, will be considered as failing to complete the course and have to re-register.\nStudents will be awarded points for constructive comments. These points are added to attendance points and group assignments.\nGroups who do not submit the group work will receive a score of 0 (zero). Late submissions will be deducted for each day of late submission.\nThe course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behavior that affects the teaching and learning process is prohibited.\nStudents must come to class on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.\nLaptops and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking notes for and calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely forbidden to use for other purposes."
