Room 13.11, Building A1, National Economics University; Phone number: 024.36280.280 (6334; 6324).\n- Teaching lecturers:\nThe course of Application of artificial intelligence in business and management belongs to the specialization knowledge block of the fields of computer and information technology, mathematics, economics, business and management.\nThe course provides basic and specialization knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop effective AI applications that applied in business and management, that is an overview issues of AI such as concepts, achievements, application fields and development trends of AI; solving problems by searching with basic search techniques, additional knowledge-based searching, and data science solving problems; machine learning methods in problem solving such as supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, semi-supervised machine learning, reinforcement learning (learning with reward and punishment) and deep learning, and methods to evaluate the performance of machine learning and deep learning systems. The course also equips knowledge about building models and developing AI applications in business and management, including the general process of building models and developing AI applications, and the main tasks as developing AI applications, building models and developing AI applications in business and management. The course includes four chapters with the following main contents: (1) Overview of artificial intelligence; (2) Solving problem of AI and data science; (3) Machine learning and deep learning methods; (4) Building models and developing AI applications in business and management. The knowledge about building models and developing AI applications in business and management (Chapter 4) is updated according to the modern development trends of artificial intelligence and society demand at the time of teaching, studying and research.\nThe course trains thinking skills, the ability to research, develop, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate problems related to AI applications in practice. Simultaneously, the course also develops the skills of independent work, team work and the ability to be autonomous and responsible.\nText Books/Lecture Notes\n[1] Từ Minh Phương (2014), Giáo trình nhập môn trí tuệ nhân tạo, Học viện công nghệ bưu chính viễn thông.\n[2] E.

Lesson plan\nStudents are allowed to take the final exam if their attendance score reaches 5 points or more (on the scale of 10).\nStudents are responsible for attending all classes. In case of absence from school due to force majeure reasons, sufficient and reasonable proofs must be provided. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted 1 point. Students who miss any classes more than 3 times, with or without reason, will be considered as failing to complete the course and have to re-register.\nStudents are considered to add points to their attendance and individual tests scores for actively constructing lessons during class sessions.\nStudents do not take tests, assignments who will receive the score of 0 (zero) a corresponding to that tests or assignments.\nThe course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behaviour that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.\nStudents must come to class on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.\nAbsolutely do not make noise, affect the others during the learning process.\nDo not work alone during class time. Absolutely do not use communication and information technology devices for personal purposes during class time."
