The primary goal of CI is to enable software developers to implement incremental changes to a codebase without compromising its quality. Throughout this course, students gain insight into various activities, tools, and deployment processes associated with CI/CD. Additionally, the course aims to cultivate skills in software development management, focusing on the integration and deployment of software. It also guides students in change management methodologies to enhance the efficiency of source code and mitigate associated risks. Practical exercises involve utilizing integrated development tools such as Git, conducting unit testing with Jasmine or Karma, and automation with Gulp and Jenkins. Furthermore, students will be organized into groups to explore various technologies more comprehensively, enabling them to present and discuss individual or group solutions to relevant issues.",

The primary goal of CI is to enable software developers to implement incremental changes to a codebase without compromising its quality. Throughout this course, students gain insight into various activities, tools, and deployment processes associated with CI/CD. Additionally, the course aims to cultivate skills in software development management, focusing on the integration and deployment of software. It also guides students in change management methodologies to enhance the efficiency of source code and mitigate associated risks. Practical exercises involve utilizing integrated development tools such as Git, conducting unit testing with Jasmine or Karma, and automation with Gulp and Jenkins. Furthermore, students will be organized into groups to explore various technologies more comprehensively, enabling them to present and discuss individual or group solutions to relevant issues.\nThe focus of the lessons is to provide:\nUnderstanding the core principles of DevOps and their relationship to CI/CD\nIn-depth and practical knowledge of Unit Testing\nComprehensive coverage of Source Control\nPractical exercises on integration testing\nPractice with big bang and incremental testing approaches.\nEstablishment of a successful CI environment and pipeline\nApplication of DevOps in business scenarios\nBusiness drivers for adopting DevOps in big data contexts.\nIntroduction to Cloud Computing\n* Textbooks/Lecture Notes:\n[1] Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (2017), by Sander Rossel, Packt\n* Additional references:\nTable 4.

Lesson plan for the course\nStudents are allowed to take the final exam if their attendance score reaches five points or more (on the scale of 10).\nStudents are responsible for attending all classes. In the case of absence from school due to force majeure reasons, sufficient and reasonable proofs must be provided. For each absence, one point will be deducted one point. Students who miss classes more than three times, with or without reason, will be considered failing to complete the course and must re-register.\nStudents will be awarded points for constructive comments. These points are added to attendance points and group assignments.\nGroups who do not submit the group work will receive a score of 0 (zero). Late submissions will be deducted for each day of late submission.\nThe course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behavior that affects the teaching and learning process is prohibited.\nStudents must come to class on time. Students over 10 minutes late after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.\nLaptops and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking notes for and calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely forbidden to use for other purposes."
