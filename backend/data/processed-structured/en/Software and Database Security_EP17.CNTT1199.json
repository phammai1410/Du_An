Emphasizing a foundational approach, it covers fundamental concepts, methodologies, and practical application scenarios. Specifically, students will receive guidance in database management aimed at safeguarding data integrity, minimizing risks such as leakage, tampering, and destruction. Additionally, the module delves into fundamental security management techniques pertinent to databases, encompassing access control, user administration, and rights management. Furthermore, it explores methods to bolster software application security and addresses challenges associated with accessing and manipulating databases from applications. Moreover, the module introduces procedures for formulating security policies, implementing continuous monitoring practices, and maintaining proactive security stances.\n* Textbooks/Lecture Notes:\n[1] R.

In the case of absence from school due to force majeure reasons, sufficient and reasonable proofs must be provided. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted 1 point. Students who miss classes more than 3 times, with or without reason, will be considered failing to complete the course and must re-register.\nStudents will be awarded points for constructive comments. These points are added to attendance points and group assignments.\nGroups who do not submit the group work will receive a score of 0 (zero). Late submissions will be deducted for each day of late submission.\nThe course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behavior that affects the teaching and learning process is prohibited.\nStudents must come to class on time. Students over 10 minutes late after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.\nLaptops and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking notes for and calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely forbidden to use for other purposes."
