The main focus of the module is on parallel programming techniques for cloud computing and the large-scale distributed systems that make up the cloud computing infrastructure. Contents include: overview of cloud computing, cloud computing systems, virtualization technology, security in the cloud, and application development in the cloud. Students will study modern solutions for cloud computing developed by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, VMWare, etc.\nThe course also aims to train thinking ability, computing skills and improve the ability to apply algorithms to analyze and research problems in the field of cloud computing. The course equips learners with the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies to search, retrieve and exploit subject-related resources and continue to higher education.\nCourse books:\n[1] Huỳnh Quyết Thắng (2014) Điện toán đám mây, Nhà xuất bản Trường Đại Học Bách Khoa Hà Nội.\nReference books:\n[2] Hwang, Kai, Jack Dongarra, and Geoffrey C.

COURSE ASSESSMENT\nTable 7.1. Course assessment\n8. TEACHING PLAN\nTable 8.1. Lesson plan\nStudents are allowed to take the final exam/terminal exam (50%) if their attendance score (10%) reaches 5 points or more (scale of 10).\nStudents/students are responsible for attending all classes. In case of absence from school due to force majeure, there must be sufficient and reasonable proofs. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted from the process assessment. Students who miss more than 3 classes, with or without reason, will be considered as not completing the course and must re-register.\nStudents will be added points for each construction speech, which can be compensated for attendance points and test scores.\nThe course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and teachers. Any behavior that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.\nStudents must come to school on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class.\nAbsolutely do not make noise, affecting others during the learning process.\nAbsolutely do not eat, chew gum, use devices such as phones, music players during class time.\nNotebooks and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking lecture notes, calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely not for other purposes."
