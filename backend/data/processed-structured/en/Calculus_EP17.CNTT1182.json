Nguyễn Quỳnh Mai Email: mainq@neu.edu.vn\nPhD. Phạm Minh Hoàn Email: hoanpm@neu.edu.vn\nKind of the course:\nCourse language: In English\nThis course provides basic concepts of numerical analysis; polynomial interpolation; function approximation. The module also provides knowledge about numerical methods in approximate calculation of derivatives and integrals, solution of equations, system of linear equations, and differential equations. Use the Matlab programming language to simulate the above methods.\nThis course also aims to train thinking skills and the ability to self-study related knowledge and technology by working independently as well as in groups. Students will be assigned group exercises to learn programming languages ​​to solve problems related to calculation methods and problems in the field of Information Technology.\n[1].

Course Goals\nTable 5.1. Course learning outcomes\nTable 6.1. Course assessment\nTable 8. Lesson plan for the course\nStudents are allowed to take the final exam if their attendance score reaches 5 points or more (on the scale of 10).\nStudents are responsible for attending all classes. In case of absence from school due to force majeure reasons, sufficient and reasonable proofs must be provided. For each absence, 1 point will be deducted 1 point. Students who miss any classes more than 3 times, with or without reason, will be considered as failing to complete the course and have to re-register.\nStudents will be awarded points for constructive comments these points are added to attendance points and group assignments.\nGroups who do not submit the group work will receive a score of 0 (zero). Late submissions will be deducted for each day of late submission.\nThe course is conducted on the principle of respecting learners and lecturers. Any behaviour that affects the teaching and learning process is strictly prohibited.\nStudents must come to class on time. Students who are late more than 10 minutes after class starts will not be allowed to attend the class. Do not make noise and affect others during the learning process.\nLaptops and tablets are only used for the purpose of taking notes for and calculating for lectures and exercises, absolutely forbidden to use for other purposes."
